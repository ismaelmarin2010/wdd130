        <h2>Argentina</h2>
        <img src="images/argentina.jpg" alt="Argentina">
        <p>Argentina is a melting pot of European elegance, Indigenous depth, and local soul — a country that feels at
            once Latin
            American and European, traditional and modern. Its Italian influence, in particular, gives Argentine culture
            its emotional warmth, expressive language, family-centered
            values, and culinary passion that distinguish it from the rest of Latin America</p>
